# MultiverseRasenganUI
A complete and optimized version of the new Multiverse Rasengan's website

This part of the website's development is about how we want it to look like.

Our primary goals are the following:
- Setting up Materialize, with a custom layout and custom effects;
- Using Gulp for automatizing tasks and optimize the web performances;
- Introducing Express and Node resources delivery;
- Obtain 100% from Google's PageSpeed
 
Our next goals, for the second part of the development, will be focused on ReactJS and its views.
For now, that's all.
